# YARHM (and YAFTFEM)

Yet another random hub menu, new exploit hub that's for everyone. It's customizable!
For more information on YARHM and the script link, visit the [ScriptBlox page.](https://scriptblox.com/script/Universal-Script-YARHM-DEV-12939)<br><br>

## Custom modules
To start making your own custom modules, refer to [testModule.lua](https://github.com/Joystickplays/psychic-octo-invention/blob/main/extraModules/imperial/testModule.lua) as a general outline.
The way the GUI works on modules is by defining each segment of the GUI (such as Text, Button, ButtonGrid, etc). The [module template](https://github.com/Joystickplays/psychic-octo-invention/blob/main/yarhm-module-template.lua) lists and references all available GUI object types.

*The YARHM script is created with a plugin that converts a ScreenGUI into a single script. This helps me update quicker. Open-sourcing the YARHM's RBXM will be soon.*
