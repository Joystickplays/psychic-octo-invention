## Custom modules
To start making your own custom modules, refer to [testModule.lua](https://github.com/Joystickplays/psychic-octo-invention/blob/main/extraModules/imperial/testModule.lua) as a general outline.
The way the GUI works on modules is by defining each segment of the GUI (such as Text, Button, ButtonGrid, etc). The [module template](https://github.com/Joystickplays/psychic-octo-invention/blob/main/yarhm-module-template.lua) lists and references all available GUI object types.
